(1) Dictionary

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

A dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).
dictionart = {key:value, ...}

(2) Python String index()
The index() method returns the index of a substring inside the string (if found). If the substring is not found, it raises an exception.

index() Syntax
It's syntax is:

str.index(sub[, start[, end]] )
index() Parameters
The index() method takes three parameters:

sub - substring to be searched in the string str.
start and end(optional) - substring is searched within str[start:end]

index() Return Value
If substring exists inside the string, it returns the lowest index in the string where substring is found.
If substring doesn't exist inside the string, it raises a ValueError exception.
The index() method is similar to the find() method for strings.

The only difference is that find() method returns -1 if the substring is not found, whereas index() throws an exception.
